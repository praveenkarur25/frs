			grown to become one of the leading flight operators with an expanding
			fleet of flights in the country. Offering excellent service with its
			well-maintained classes and courteous staff, XYZ Flight services

			sights on almost all the vast airways of the South. The runaway
			success of the company and the popularity of its flight service is

			management. Born in the year 1949 at village called at Thiruchengode
			in Namakkal district. Er.R.SRINIVASAN is simple and most unassuming,

			his career as a tour operator in 1968, Later, in 1971, he realized
			the need for regular flight services between major cities. Thus was
			born XYZ flight services in 1972. At the age of 23, he started the
			first service of XYZ Flights between Chennai and Bangalore. Initially
